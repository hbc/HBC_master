As we are often away from the office, the best way to contact us for general enquiries and project requests is by **[emailing us](mailto:bioinformatics@hsph.harvard.edu)**. Generally, you can expect a response within 48 hours so we can start to assess your needs and setup a meeting in person. For administrative requests, please contact [Megan Scott](mailto:mescott@hsph.harvard.edu). Billing inquiries and grant-related questions are handled by [Rachel Boschetto](mailto:rboschet@hsph.harvard.edu). Alternatively, you can try calling us at 617-432-4917 or just stop by our office.

### Office Location

We are located at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, SPH2, 2nd floor, Rooms 202B and 215, 655 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115.
