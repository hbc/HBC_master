To request a consultation to discuss your experiment, grant application or manuscript, please contact us **by email at [bioinformatics@hsph.harvard.edu](mailto:bioinformatics@hsph.harvard.edu)**. Generally, you can expect a response within 48 hours so we can start to assess your needs and setup a meeting in person. Please note that we may have a queue and it can take time for us to start an analysis after speaking with you. 

If you have any questions about the training program or upcoming workshops, please **[email](mailto:hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu) the training team** directly. 

Please direct any financial enquiries to [Rachel Boschetto](mailto:rboschet@hsph.harvard.edu).
