With funding from the [HMS Tools and Technology Committee](https://hms.harvard.edu/research/hms-researcher-resources/tools-and-technology) and the [Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI)](https://hsci.harvard.edu/) we have a dedicated bioinformatics training program for:

- HMS researchers with a primary affiliation in one of the Basic and Social Science Departments on the Quad 
- HSCI researchers 

*In addition, we also teach short courses for [Harvard Catalyst](http://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/bioinformatics-workshops/).*

### Upcoming workshops/courses:

Please find a list of our various offerings below categorized by eligibility. If you would like to receive emails from us about training opportunities, please fill out [this form](https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6nGqk2i8RUi2oN7). 

#### For HSCI and on-quad HMS researchers

* April 30th - May 1st, 2018: *Introduction to R*. **Registration is now open, more information at [http://tinyurl.com/hbc-intro-r-info]()!** 
* May 30th - May 31st, 2018: *Introduction to shell and High-Performance Computing*. **Registration opens on May 9th.**

#### For all researchers at Harvard University and affiliated institutions

We are excited to announce a new set of workshops for Spring 2018 in the **Current Topics in Bioinformatics** series of short workshops. 

Similar to last semester, each of these **2 to 3 hour**, **hands-on** workshops are freestanding, but some of them will have prerequisites. They will be held **monthly** in the Longwood Medical Area at either HSPH or HMS. The workshops are first-come-first-served and there is no registration process, so we encourage you to be punctual! 

Please **bring a laptop** to be able to follow along in class. For instructions to prepare yourself and your laptop for the workshop, please click on the link to the workshop you are interested in attending in the table below.

### Training program description:

We provide bioinformatics training through both **shorter workshops** and **in-depth courses**. [[Click here](http://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/training/#upcoming-workshopscourses) for a list of upcoming workshops/courses]

#### 1. Workshops 

These workshops vary in duration from half-day to 3 days and are aimed at biologists interested in expanding their knowledge of Next-Generation Sequence (NGS) data analysis, and basic computational skills for working with big or small datasets.

* **Next-Generation Sequencing**

	Short workshops on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq to introduce basic concepts of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. The goal of these workshops are to enable researchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analyses using best practices.

* **Basic Skills for Data Analysis**	

	Topics include R, data visualization using R, Linux shell, High-Performance Computing (HPC), version control, Research Data Management, etc.

#### 2.  In-Depth Next Generation Sequencing Analysis Courses

These intensive courses run for 8-12 days and are aimed at bench biologists interested in learning **how to perform independent, best practice NGS-based analyses**. Topics include:

- Unix & High-Performance Computing ([O2](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/))
- NGS data analysis (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Variant calling)
- Statistical analysis using R
- Functional analysis

*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for our workshops or courses unless explicitly stated.*
