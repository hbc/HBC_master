With funding from the [HMS Tools and Technology Committee](https://hms.harvard.edu/research/hms-researcher-resources/tools-and-technology) and the [Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI)](https://hsci.harvard.edu/) we have a dedicated bioinformatics training program for:

- HMS researchers with a primary affiliation in one of the Basic and Social Science Departments on the Quad 
- HSCI researchers 

*In addition, we also teach short courses for [Harvard Catalyst](http://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/bioinformatics-workshops/).*

## Training program description:

We provide bioinformatics training through both **shorter workshops** and **in-depth courses**. [[Click here](http://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/training/#upcoming-workshopscourses) for a list of upcoming workshops/courses]

### 1. Workshops 

These workshops vary in duration from half-day to 3 days and are aimed at biologists interested in expanding their knowledge of Next-Generation Sequence (NGS) data analysis, and basic computational skills for working with big or small datasets.

* **Next-Generation Sequencing**

	Short workshops on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq to introduce basic concepts of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. The goal of these workshops are to enable researchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analyses using best practices.

* **Basic Skills for Data Analysis**	

	Topics include R, data visualization using R, Linux shell, High-Performance Computing (HPC), version control, Research Data Management, etc.

### 2.  In-Depth Next Generation Sequencing Analysis Courses

These intensive courses run for 8-12 days and are aimed at bench biologists interested in learning **how to perform independent, best practice NGS-based analyses**. Topics include:

- Unix & High-Performance Computing ([O2](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/))
- NGS data analysis (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Variant calling)
- Statistical analysis using R
- Functional analysis

*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for our workshops or courses unless explicitly stated.*
