With funding from the [HMS Tools and Technology Committee](https://hms.harvard.edu/research/hms-researcher-resources/tools-and-technology) and the [Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI)](https://hsci.harvard.edu/) we have a dedicated bioinformatics training program for:

- HMS researchers with a primary affiliation in one of the Basic and Social Science Departments on the Quad 
- HSCI researchers 

*In addition, we also teach short courses for [Harvard Catalyst](http://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/bioinformatics-workshops/).*
