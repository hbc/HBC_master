<p><img style="float: left; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px;" src="/images/hsph_building.jpg" width="250" /></p> The [Harvard School of Public Health](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) (HSPH) has taken a leading role in interdisciplinary research involving the computational analysis of complex relationships between genes and their environment as well as basic biological and quantitative sciences. The Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core (HBC) is integral to the development and application of computational biology methods at the School.

### Mission

HBC provides a single point of contact for Harvard researchers interested in bioinformatics support, applying genomic approaches together with established and developing methodologies from epidemiology, environmental health, biostatistics and bioinformatics to improve human health.

[Core staff](/people) aid researchers within the Harvard community with the management, integration and contextual analysis of biological high-throughput data, focusing on next-generation sequencing support. We [provide consulting, training, tools, databases and best practices](/services), foster collaboration and a community of bioinformatics activities, and build a unified infrastructure supporting a diverse set of experimental systems and high-throughput biological data.


### Working with us

**Consults are billed at $150/hour after an initial meeting to discuss your project.**  We will provide you with an estimate of the number of hours required, a quote and a start date as part of our [Memorandum of Understanding](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/407047/Ghost/hbc/CHB%20MOU.pdf) (PDF). During the project you will receive detailed monthly billing updates and ongoing analysis results via our project page.

**Fees for pilot projects and other short term consults can be subsidized in many cases through support from our [funding partners](/funders)**. If in doubt [ask us for more information](/contact)!

Please note that **payment of fees for data analysis services and authorship are not mutually exclusive**. Depending on their contributions to a project, HBC Data Analysts might be considered collaborators at the same level as other academic colleagues who contribute intellectually and receive funding for work on a project. We follow the [general guidelines for authorship](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) laid out by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. The recovery of Core expenses through the recharge system does not exclude the possibility for authorship for Core personnel. Similarly, authorship does not substitute for payment of Core expenses for services rendered.
